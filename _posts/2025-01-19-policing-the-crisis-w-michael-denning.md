Featuring Michael Denning on *Policing the Crisis: Mugging, the State and Law and Order*, collectively authored by Stuart Hall and his colleagues at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. Hall’s method of Marxist conjunctural analysis applied to the generalized crisis that paved the way for neoliberalism’s rise; a model for how we should ask questions about our world that will provide us with knowledge we need to change it.
