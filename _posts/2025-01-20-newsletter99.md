The Dig’s [series](https://thedigradio.com/podcast/oligarchy-empire-revolution-w-hilary-goodfriend-jorge-cuellar/) of [episodes](https://thedigradio.com/podcast/neoliberalism-violence-migration-w-hilary-goodfriend-jorge-cuellar/) on [Central America](https://thedigradio.com/podcast/crypto-dystopia-or-popular-democracy-w-hilary-goodfriend-jorge-cuellar/) takes us through the deeper history of a region whose past is by turns tragic and strange, filled with stories of struggle, heroism, imperial terror, political cruelty, and popular resistance. Central America’s political development has been shaped by two overarching realities: first, the predominance of a local elite that rules over a politically disempowered population, sometimes using unthinkable violence to protect its wealth and influence, and second, the looming presence of the United States, the imperial colossus to the north that has long considered Central America its backyard.

Listeners who know something about Central America might think of recent news of migration from and through the isthmus to the southern border of the United States, of Donald Trump’s recent threats to take back the Panama Canal (which I discuss in a recent New York Times [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/01/opinion/panama-canal-trump-china-drought.html?unlocked_article_code=1.l04.AEbe.e0X1h7gOXb4d\&smid=url-share)), or of the bizarre, dangerous, and headline-grabbing president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele (about whose crypto schemes read Jorge Cuéllar in New Left Review’s [Sidecar](https://newleftreview.org/sidecar/posts/bitcoin-sanctuaries) and [Jacobin América Latina](https://jacobinlat.com/2022/06/la-republica-del-bitcoin/)) . Others might remember the bloody civil wars — all fought with the material support and political encouragement of the United States — or the legacy of US-sponsored regime change that helped forestall popular democracy and ensure that left-wing governments, even if they got into power, could rarely deliver on their promised reforms. 

To understand the US’s long fixation on Central America though, it’s best to go back. Long before Bukele, before the US-deposed leftist Guatemalan president Jacobo Árbenz, before the Nicaraguan revolutionary Augusto Sandino and Anastasio Somoza, the dictator who assassinated him, there was the original agent of regime change, the filibuster William Walker.

The nineteenth-century United States was hungry for expansion and eager to find places where its borders might be extended. The Louisiana Purchase had doubled the size of the country; the annexation of Texas and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War (a war of aggression and territorial conquest) by signing over more than half of Mexico’s territory to the US. By the beginning of the 1850s, it seemed, the country looked set to expand even further south.

Enter the filibusters, private citizens who aimed to overthrow foreign governments, establish new colonies, and, perhaps, sue for annexation by the United States. Among the most consequential of these was Narciso López, a Venezuelan adventurer who twice invaded Spanish-held Cuba from the United States. López had the backing of powerful Southern interests who saw Cuba as a possible new slave state, and he commanded a private army of soldiers of fortune. Though López failed in both attempts (he was executed by the Spanish in the aftermath of the second), his example inspired others, like the Tennessee-born lawyer William Walker. 

Walker’s very first filibustering attempt, a private invasion of Baja California, Mexico, ended in catastrophe, but by 1855, Nicaraguan Liberals, embroiled in a civil war against the Conservatives, thought that an injection of men and energy might help them win. They invited Walker to bring his mercenaries to Nicaragua and fight on the Liberal side.

Walker succeeded. He succeeded to such an extent that after defeating the Conservatives, he found himself the only real authority in the land. He acted as the power behind the throne to a Nicaraguan civil government, but Walker was, by all accounts, a megalomaniac. He referred to himself in writing in the third person. He carefully managed his image in the United States, and, in Nicaragua, promised a total overhaul of society. He wanted, as he put it in his 1860 memoir, for “the American element [to predominate](https://archive.org/details/warinnicaragua00walk) in the government of Nicaragua.” 

But Walker’s efforts soon went off the rails. Beyond ruling Nicaragua, Walker desired to create a Central American empire peopled by Anglo-American settlers. He imported colonists by the thousands, offering them free land upon emigration to Nicaragua. He placed white American filibusters in important positions in government and administration, seized land, and appropriated it for his followers. 

Though Walker had initially enjoyed broad support among elite and popular segments of Nicaraguan society, the radical nature of his reforms combined with the white supremacist turn in his governing agenda (he sought, as leading pro-slavery voice DeBow’s Review put it, to “place a large proportion of the lands of the country in the hands of the [white race](https://www.google.com/books/edition/De_Bow_s_Review/9iF-EAAAQBAJ?hl=en\&gbpv=1\&dq=%E2%80%9Cto+place+a+large+portion+of+the+land+of+the+country+in+the+hands+of+the+white+race\&pg=PA156\&printsec=frontcover)”) ultimately destroyed his popularity among the Nicaraguan people. He went to war with Costa Rica, which opposed the filibuster government as an existential threat to local rule in Central America, and eventually a coalition of all the Central American republics rallied to the Costa Rican side (except Panama, which remained part of Colombia until 1903 — but that’s another story). In a bid for support from the US South, Walker reestablished slavery, promising to make Nicaragua a slaveholding society in which whites would rule, mestizo Central Americans would have limited rights, and black enslaved workers would toil under the lash. 

Perhaps most fatally, Walker expropriated the land and property of the Accessory Transit Company, a venture established by Cornelius Vanderbilt to offer passage across the isthmus for travelers heading from the East Coast to California. The gold rush was on in 1855, and before the coming of the transcontinental railroad, travelers hoping to reach California had three options. They could travel across the continent in wagons (you have died of [dysentery](https://notevenpast.org/wp-content/uploads/dysentery.jpeg)), sail around Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America (a voyage of nearly 200 days covering over 13,000 nautical miles), or cross the continent at its narrowest point — the Central American isthmus — taking less than a quarter of the time. The most popular route was across Panama; the second most popular was across Nicaragua. 

The territory, then, had enormous strategic value: even in the mid-nineteenth century, there was talk of an eventual ship canal across the isthmus. The area was also an imperial battleground. The Spanish had only recently left, and while the United States and its commercial interests lurked, so too did the British, who ruled the nearby West Indies, exploited the markets of newly independent Latin America, controlled British Honduras (now Belize), had agents among the indigenous Miskito people in Nicaragua, and thought that they too might one day benefit from a canal. Some speculators got rich in the goldfields of California, but the real money was in getting them there. In the 1850s, anyone who wanted to cross Nicaragua to catch a California-bound ship had to buy a ticket from Cornelius Vanderbilt.

When Walker seized the transit from Vanderbilt, transferring the rights to Vanderbilt’s business rivals, he sealed his own fate: Vanderbilt began aiding the Central American coalition, and worked to close the transit altogether. With the transit route shuttered, Walker could not communicate with the Eastern United States, bring in new recruits, or purchase supplies. Beset by the armies of Central America, cut off from his friends, and without the aid of any sovereign power and unable to recruit reinforcements, Walker soon had to flee the country in defeat, surrendering to a US Navy ship with a handful of his miserable followers. 

He returned to the US only long enough to gin up publicity and attempt further invasions. In 1860, he sailed for Honduras and was captured by the British Royal Navy, who turned him over to local authorities. They shot him and buried him in a modest grave in the Caribbean city of Trujillo.

While Walker never acted on behalf of the US government, he signaled that, for Central Americans, US citizens would exercise their powers without regard to the political legitimacy of Central American governments or the wishes of Central American people. Thus Walker established a pattern that still echoes today. The United States continued to intervene, in formal and informal ways, establishing banana plantations, installing and removing local governments, alienating pieces of sovereign territory, occupying countries (sometimes for decades at a time), funding gangs, and hiding atrocities.

Few Americans know of Walker today, but he remains a major part of Central American historical memory. He was memorialized by the Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Cardenal in his poem “[With Walker in Nicaragua](https://www.jonathancohenweb.com/walker.html),” based on a series of magazine articles written by Clinton Rollins, a veteran of the Walker expedition, and published in the San Francisco Chronicle [in 1909](https://sajurin.enriquebolanos.org/docs/CR_19_Cronicas_filibusteros_con_Walker.pdf). Though Cardenal’s is one of the more accomplished literary retellings of the Walker story, the most bizarre is Alex Cox’s 1987 film [Walker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096409/), starring Ed Harris and with music by Joe Strummer of The Clash. Produced while US-sponsored civil conflict still raged across the region — in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala — the film offers an absurdist and postmodern critique of US empire then and now, with a pointed message about the human cost of imperial hubris. If you want a more scholarly approach, historian Michel Gobat has written the most recent, and most complete, account of Walker’s quixotic mission and ultimate downfall. Gobat’s [Empire by Invitation](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674737495) details Walker’s relationship to empire, liberalism, and the Nicaraguan political system while exploding some of the most well-worn myths about Walker and his regime.
