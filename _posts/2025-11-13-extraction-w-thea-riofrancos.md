Featuring Thea Riofrancos on *Extraction: The Frontiers of Green Capitalism*. The green energy transition requires a vast array of inputs: copper, cobalt, rare earth elements, and the focus of this discussion, lithium—all of which must be mined from the earth. This is a wide-ranging discussion stretching from Chile to Nevada, and from the dawn of colonialism to the geoeconomic conflict between the US and China—and a lot more.

In New York City? See Thea discuss *Extraction* with David Wallace-Wells. Friday, November 14 at McNally Jackson Seaport. Say hi to Dan if you attend! Tickets here: mcnallyjackson.com/event/thea-riofrancos-david-wallace-wells
