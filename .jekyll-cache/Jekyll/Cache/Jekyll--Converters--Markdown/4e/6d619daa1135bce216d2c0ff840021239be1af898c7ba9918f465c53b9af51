I"†<p>Last week was a bad week for Republicans and a good week for Democratsâ€”and for Democratic Socialists. Itâ€™s now pretty clear that Republicans will pay a price for the fact that large numbers of Americans detest our dotard-in-chief. But last weekâ€™s election once again fails to offer any sort of definitive answer to the long-running debate between the left and the corporate Democratic establishment over who is best poised to beat Republicans. The coming anti-Republican wave is an opportunity that the left must seize. Danâ€™s guests are DSA member Lee Carter, who took out the Republican whip to win Virginiaâ€™s 50th House District, and David Duhalde, DSAâ€™s Deputy Director. Thanks to our sponsors at Verso Books.
