I"Á<p>Chattel slavery made black womenâ€™s reproduction the source of private propertyâ€”and in doing so invented race and American racism. Ever since, the denigration and regulation of black womenâ€™s childbearing has been central to the construction of white supremacy and the exploitative economic order that it protects, as scholar Dorothy Roberts explained in Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty, a pivotal book first published in 1997. In this episode, @DorothyERoberts talks about the book and what lessons it holds today as Trump and Republicans seek to destroy yet more of the social safety net and use racism as a smokescreen to distract white Americans from their class war against working people.
