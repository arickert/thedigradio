I"ê<p>Donald Trump launched his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants â€œrapistsâ€ and pledged to build a â€œa big, fat, beautiful wallâ€ on the southern border that, of course, Mexico is going to pay for. Itâ€™s no surprise that Trumpâ€™s message struck a chord: right-wing nativism has been rising for decades and hardcore xenophobes had long since taken over the Republican Party. Worse yet, so-called immigration moderates on both sides of the aisleâ€”including Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obamaâ€”have sought to placate those reactionary forces by militarizing the border and orchestrating mass deportations. Now that Trump has won the presidency, undocumented immigrants are rightly worried and mobilizing to defend their communities.</p>
