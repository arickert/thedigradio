<p>With Trump, Mexico is the symbol and source of so many things that are wrong with the United States. Oftentimes, these stories told about Mexico in the United States arenâ€™t just wrong but serve to obscure the true source of our shared problemsâ€”which, more often than not, are both countriesâ€™ ruling classes. Todayâ€™s guest is Christy Thornton, a professor of history and international studies at Rowan University, and soon to be fellow at the Weatherhead Research Cluster on Global Transformations at Harvard. Thanks to our supporters at University of California Press.</p>
