<p>In 1975, a group of radical â€œurbanologistsâ€ met at the New School for Social Research to discuss how to understand the eraâ€™s housing crisis from a Marxist perspective. The urban thinkers expressed frustration with both a liberal tradition of urban sociology that attributed spatial segregation to natural variations in land use <em>and</em> a leftist tradition that struggled to theorize how capitalâ€™s power manifested off the factory floor. In an edited volume titled <em>Marxism and the Metropolis</em>, the urbanologists posited a new framework that identified residential space as a key site of class struggle.</p>

<p>But while they argued that the pursuit of profit caused the housing crisis, the urbanologists struggled to identify how to <em>address</em> the crisis. A second volume of <em>Marxism and the Metropolis</em> tried to fill in the gap, but even a long essay on the history of tenant organizing expressed skepticism that rent strikes could make more than a â€œsmall dentâ€ in the power of landlords and developers. After all, Marxists had long expressed skepticism about workersâ€™ capacity to organize outside of the realm of production. Even Friedrich Engelsâ€™s canonical <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1872/housing-question">essay series</a> on the â€œhousing questionâ€ in 1870s England concluded that workers had leverage only where they produced value, in the workplace.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve come a long way since the 1870s, and even the 1970s. Thanks to scholars such as <a href="https://thedigradio.com/podcast/modern-housing-w-gail-radford">Gail Radford</a> and <a href="https://thedigradio.com/podcast/new-deal-ruins-w-edward-goetz">Edward Goetz</a> â€” whom weâ€™ve hosted on <em>The Dig</em> in recent weeks â€” housing has moved from the periphery to the center of leftist scholarship. And as Rene Moya, Tracy Rosenthal, Shanti Singh, and Cea Weaver argue in our most recent episode, a growing grassroots movement has shown that organizing tenants is key to addressing not only the permanent housing crisis but multiple, connected crises of labor, health, and the environment. This weekâ€™s guests make a case that despite persistent skepticism about their potential and a nearly complete lack of legal protections for their efforts, tenant organizers can pose a formidable challenge not only to landlords but also to the capitalist system more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>Listen to this weekâ€™s episode of <em>The Dig</em> <a href="https://thedigradio.com/podcast/the-politics-and-practice-of-tenant-organizing">here</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Among the many reasons why tenant organizing is so crucial to workersâ€™ broader struggle, here are two. First, employers and landlords rely on each otherâ€™s power. As this weekâ€™s guests point out, theyâ€™re often one and the same: New York University, for instance, is both a major employer and an owner of a significant portion of residential property in Manhattan. More broadly, housing precarity disciplines workers as employees while labor precarity disciplines workers as tenants. You are less likely to organize your workplace if youâ€™re afraid a strike means you wonâ€™t be able to make your rent, and youâ€™re less likely to organize your building if youâ€™re afraid an eviction will make it impossible to hold down your job. (This is also a fundamentally feminist insight: power in the workplace always depends on power in the home, and vice versa. Women are at the forefront of the tenant movement â€” and always have been â€” because their unpaid labor enables landlords to keep tenantsâ€™ housing in minimally survivable condition, as it enables employers to pay workers minimally survivable wages.)</p>

<p>Second, as this weekâ€™s guests argue, tenant organizing isnâ€™t only about seizing the right to safe and affordable housing but also about seizing the right to <em>land</em>. Thatâ€™s why tenant organizers are now targeting investors and property developers as well as landlords. Indeed, we can understand evictions, foreclosures, and slum clearance as part of a long process of land theft and dispossession that has pushed workers â€” especially workers of color â€” out of their communities of support and into an exploitative labor market whose terms they have little ability, on their own, to contest. This is the process, of course, that created and continues to create capitalism itself. I came away from this weekâ€™s episode thinking that fighting evictions and rising rents is only the beginning of a much broader struggle to reclaim space for workersâ€™ own control.</p>
