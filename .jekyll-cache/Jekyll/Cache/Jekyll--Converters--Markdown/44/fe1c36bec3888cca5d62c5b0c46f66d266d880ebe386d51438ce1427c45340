I"‹<p>This weekâ€™s super series on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s victory and the future of left politics continues with Julia Salazar, a DSA member running for a Brooklyn state Senate in New Yorkâ€™s District 18. Salazarâ€™s campaign worked hard for Ocasio-Cortez; now, Ocasio-Cortezâ€™s team is returning the favor. Recently, The New York Daily News wondered if Salazar might be the new Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez responded: Salazar â€œisnâ€™t the next me, sheâ€™s the first HER.â€ Indeed, Salazar has her own story to tell. She immigrated from Colombia as a child, and came of age as a young activist by organizing a rent strike in her Harlem building. She describes herself as a democratic socialist, which she defines as recognizing â€œthe capitalist system as being inherently oppressive and actively working to dismantle it and to empower the working class and the marginalized in our society.â€</p>
