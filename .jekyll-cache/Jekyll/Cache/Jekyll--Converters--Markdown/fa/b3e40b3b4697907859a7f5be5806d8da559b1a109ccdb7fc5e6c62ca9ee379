I"•<p>Many Americans take the existence of so-called â€œillegal immigrantsâ€ for granted, whatever their opinion of the matter. But illegality isnâ€™t a property of immigrants; rather, itâ€™s a creation of positive law. And we can only understand how immigrants are declared â€œillegalâ€ by the government by examining this countryâ€™s too-often ignored history of racist and exclusionary immigration politics. Danâ€™s guest today is Mae Ngai, an historian at Columbia and the author of Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America. Thanks to Verso Books.
