I"∆<p>It‚Äôs yet the latest installment in our ongoing series on the left and electoral politics. Dan‚Äôs guest is Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi. Last year, Mayor Lumumba pledged to make Jackson ‚Äúthe most radical city on the planet.‚Äù Lumumba, who comes out of a decades-old revolutionary black nationalist movement, is serious about that. But he also faces serious challenges: Jackson is a majority black city which, like many such cities, has much of its wealth appropriated by its largely-white suburbs. The human and infrastructural needs are enormous, and the tax base is thin. This is precisely why so many on the left have found what‚Äôs going on in Jackson to be so interesting, and why Dan was eager to invite the mayor onto the show.</p>
