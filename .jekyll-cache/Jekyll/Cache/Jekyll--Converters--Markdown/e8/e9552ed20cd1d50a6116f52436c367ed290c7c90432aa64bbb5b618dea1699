I"é<p>Newsletter #13: A Path Forward for Workers in Rust Belt America, with Gabriel Winant</p>

<p>by Benjamin Feldman</p>

<p>Between the recognition of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937 and their 116-day strike in 1959, Pittsburghâ€™s steelworkers fought for â€” and won â€” health and disability insurance, pensions, consistent wage increases, and a slice of decency and dignity on the job. Sixty years later, steel is only Pittsburghâ€™s sixteenthÂ largest employer, and roughly one out of every five workers in the Steel City works in health care or social assistance.Â </p>

<p>That service work has eclipsed manufacturing across the Rust Belt is well-understood. Less understood is the argument at the center ofÂ 
<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674238091">Gabriel Winantâ€™sÂ </a>: that the industrial economyÂ 
Â the care economy. Reconstructing the â€œsocial worldâ€ that Pittsburgh steel made, Winant shows that â€œas the industrial basis of this world began to collapse, its inhabitants â€¦ drew on the resources they had, embedded in the relationships and identities they had already built. â€¦Their world was melted down and recast,â€ Winant writes, â€œbut it was still made from the same materials.â€</p>

<p>Pittsburghâ€™s economy was built and maintained through a series of compromises, which temporarily defended the economic citizenship of a mostly white and male cohort of union workersÂ in partÂ (but only in part) through the exclusion of large numbers of women and African Americans. Winant shows that, as manufacturing crumbled, these excluded workers found jobs in the areaâ€™s rapidly expanding network of hospitals and nursing homes â€” an expansion
Â made possible by financialization and necessitated by the increasing health care needs of a mid-century labor force prematurely aged by the ravages of a lifetime in the mills. The low wages paid to this mostly non-union, and disproportionately Black and female, workforce have led to Pittsburgh having one of theÂ 
<a href="https://pittsburghunited.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/New-Day-in-the-Neighborhood.pdf">highest African-American poverty rates in</a>Â the United States.</p>

<p>Beyond untangling the roots of the increasingly precarious, contingent, and uncertain economy of the twenty-firstÂ century, Winant suggests a possible path forward â€” one that does not rely on nostalgia for the mid-twentieth centuryâ€™s industrial labor force. Instead, Winant offers a vision of a shared politics wherein both those receiving care 
 the essential workers providing that care unite in struggle for a more inclusive social citizenship.Â </p>
