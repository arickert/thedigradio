I"İ<p>New Republic writer Sarah Jones joins Dan to talk about Trumpâ€™s invocation of the â€œalt-leftâ€ and  to explain the termâ€™s unseemly centrist history. And more. Weâ€™re gonna try doing two episodes each week now: the regular long Dig on Tuesdays and a shorter, hotter-take Diglet on Fridays. This will take more time and more money.
