I"Á<p>Today, weâ€™re talking about Italy, where a so-called â€œpopulistâ€ alliance of the Five Star Movement and right-wing League just took over the government with anti-migrant and Euro-skeptic agenda. Danâ€™s guest is David Broder, a historian of French and Italian communism and frequent contributor to Jacobin. The Five Star Movement was for a time welcomed by some on the left. But itâ€™s not of the left; rather, it is a product of the Italian leftâ€™s collapse.</p>
