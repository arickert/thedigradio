I"©<p>Donald Trumpâ€™s election was shocking, if actually not so surprising, and has prompted widespread protests against a cresting right-wing reaction taking shape as a strange and potent combination of white nationalism, make-believe economic populism, libertarian orthodoxy, America-first isolationism and War on Terror extremism. It has also prompted us to relaunch this podcast. Today, weâ€™ll be discussing why Trump won and what that says about the political moment in the United States.</p>
