I"É<p>For libertarians, liberty means something different. Itâ€™s about liberty for property owners. And in their quest to preserve that absolute freedom for the ownership classâ€”whether their assets be human slaves, factories or extractive industriesâ€”democracy must be curtailed and the power of the people must be checked and repressed.</p>

<p>This is the argument put forward by Danâ€™s guest, historian Nancy MacLean, in her book Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Rightâ€™s Stealth Plan for America. The book makes a powerful argument for the anti-democratic origins and trajectory of free-market fundamentalist Koch-Brothers-aligned economists who have come to profoundly shape and warp American politics to fit their dystopian vision. The book has also been controversial.</p>
