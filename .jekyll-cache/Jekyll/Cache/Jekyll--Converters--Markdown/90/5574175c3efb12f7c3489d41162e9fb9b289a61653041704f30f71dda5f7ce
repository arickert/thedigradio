I"€<p>Centrist business elites believe in an America that doesnâ€™t exist. Two guests this episode: first, @mollyesque talks about her pieceÂ â€On Safari in Trumpâ€™s Americaâ€ for her article follows the centrist organization Third Way on a â€œlistening tourâ€ of the real America. Then @EricLevitz (35:52), who just published on op-ed in the entitled â€œAmerica is not â€˜center-right,â€ sorts through research to argue that what Americans often mean when they say they are â€œmoderateâ€ is not the combination of superficial social progressivism and neoliberalism that Wall-Street-aligned Third Way types think they mean.
