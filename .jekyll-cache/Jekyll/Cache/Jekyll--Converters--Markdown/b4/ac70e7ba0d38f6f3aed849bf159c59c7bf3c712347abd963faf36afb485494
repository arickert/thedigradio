I"Û<p>Newsletter #3: Imagining Utopia in a Time of Climate Disaster with Kim Stanley Robinson</p>

<p>By William Harris</p>

<p>By now youâ€™ve seen the signs, planted across the liberal meadows of our nationâ€™s lawns with a solemn pledge: â€œIn this house, we believe: science is real.â€ Framed by this oath, science becomes an apolitical set of facts blindly assented toÂ â€”Â which then easily translates into yet more grist for the neverending culture war between rational Democrats and troglodytic Republicans.</p>

<p>How should todayâ€™s Left approach science? Few approach this question as thoughtfully as legendary science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, hailed by the 
New Yorkeras perhaps 
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/our-greatest-political-novelist">â€œour greatest political novelist,â€</a> author of many books â€” from the 
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/ZMS/mars-trilogy">Mars</a> trilogy to 2019â€™s 
<a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/kim-stanley-robinson/the-ministry-for-the-future/9780316300162/">Ministry for the Future</a>â€”and our guest on a provocative new episode of 
The Dighosted by pod-comrade and Berkeley sociologist Daniel Aldana Cohen.</p>

<p>For Robinson, science is a utopian project that the Left should claim. A â€œmodestâ€ way of knowing the world, importantly available to specialists but also to all of us, science lives out an always-incomplete story full of dynamic adaptation, democratic debate, and messy engagement with the material world. If science has historically been a project shot through by warring interests â€” too often colonial and corporate â€” one of these competing interests has been the idealist, Left-aligned objective of improving the world for all.</p>

<p>Robinson comes to these reflections as a novelist whoâ€™s spent his career telling stories that entwine ecology and social justice. We live amid climate disaster; for science, that means that now is a time when, in considering technological fixes to climate change, â€œit all has to be put on the table.â€ Controversially, he insists, that means rethinking ecological and political approaches from geo-engineering to nuclear energy to Green New Deal-prompted quantitative easing.</p>

<p>Robinsonâ€™s broad-tent openness to a range of scientific possibilities to save our planet also comes from his experience as a novelist. His novels play out possible futures and dramatize a range of leftist and scientific debates, giving narrative shape to our most pressing ecological and political questions. Amid a growing body of criticism indicting contemporary literature for its failure to come to imaginative terms with ecological disaster â€” from Amitav Ghoshâ€™s 2016 book 
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html">The Great Derangement</a> to Rithika Ramamurthyâ€™s recent takedown of the 
<a href="https://www.thedriftmag.com/climate-anxiety/">â€œClimate Anxiety Novelâ€</a> â€” Robinsonâ€™s work stands out as compellingly original approaches to possible climate futures. His latest epic 
Ministry for the Future imagines how a plausible â€œbest-case scenarioâ€ under climate change future might come about, raising difficult questions of left ecological politics that he discusses with Cohen.</p>
