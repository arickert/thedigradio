I"Ç<p>Newsletter #5: Desire Is Political, with Amia Srinivasan</p>

<p>by Maia Silber</p>

<p>Conversations about the politics of sex often focus on the presence or absence of consent. For feminist philosopher Amia Srinivasan, this is a profoundly inadequate framework â€” one that leaves us ill-prepared to interrogate the power dynamics that shape even the sex we freely choose, and suggests carceral remedies likely to harm societyâ€™s most vulnerable members.</p>

<p>Searching for alternatives, Srinivasanâ€™s 
The Right to Sex: Feminism in the Twenty-First Centuryreaches back to the â€œsex warsâ€ of the 1970s, when feminists fiercely debated how power informs our desires. In those debates, she often finds more questions than answers. Can we treat sex as political without subjecting ourselves and others to an authoritarian moralism? Can we reject the sexual shaming so often weaponized against women, queer, and gender non-conforming people without succumbing to the fantasy that our desires are wholly natural?</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging conversation on 
The Dig,Srinivasan brings these questions to bear on contemporary debates about sex on college campuses, pornography, and sex work. She argues, for instance, against critics who claim that teachers who enter consensual relationships with students donâ€™t deserve our censure, while insisting that institutional responses do more to protect universities from liability than young people from abuse. She urges us to take seriously the power of pornography to shape not only sexual actions but also sexual affects and urges in harmful ways, even while recognizing the mediumâ€™s potential for inspiring radical modes of pleasure and sexual agency.</p>

<p>The titular essay in 
The Right to Sexcontroversially examines the claims of â€œincelâ€ (involuntarily celibate) men to sexual entitlement. While Srinivasan insists that there is no right to sex, she takes seriously incelsâ€™ contention that sexual attraction is distributed unequally along hierarchies of race, class, and conventional attractiveness.</p>

<p>Incels hypocritically lament the ways these hierarchies harm them even while they subscribe to their valorization of certain kinds of bodies: the rich, thin, white women they call â€œStacys.â€ Srinivasan thinks that we can take inspiration instead from queer and Black women who have asked us to critically interrogate who and how we desire. For Srinivasan, this isnâ€™t about repressionÂ â€”Â itâ€™s about openness to the forms of sex and love that are blocked by our current power structures.</p>
