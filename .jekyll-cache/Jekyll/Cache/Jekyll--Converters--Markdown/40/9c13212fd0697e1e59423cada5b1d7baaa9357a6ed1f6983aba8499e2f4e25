I"Î<p>Hugo ChÃ¡vezâ€™s rise to power inspired leftists around the world. But today, Venezuela is in a profound economic and political crisis. A huge decline in oil prices gutted the revenue stream that Venezuela depended on to bankroll its social spending. The government led by Chavezâ€™s successor NicolÃ¡s Maduro is increasingly turning to repression in response to constant, and often violent, protests from the opposition. NYU historian and NACLA Executive Editor Alejandro Velasco explains whatâ€™s happening in Venezuela, how it happenedâ€”and how the promise of the Bolivarian Revolution might still be salvaged.
