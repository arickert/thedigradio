I"’<p>This is part two of Dan‚Äôs interview on Hannah Arendt‚Äôs notion of ‚Äúthe right to have rights.‚Äù This episode covers a lot, including why we must fight not only to expand the democratic political community but also to deepen its power‚Äîall at a time when the nativist right is exploiting the many crises unleashed by neoliberalism and empire to erect walls and punish scapegoats. One upshot is that zombie liberalism can‚Äôt be the answer, because it is precisely the liberal order that is a key source of the problem.</p>

<p>Dan‚Äôs guests today, Stephanie DeGooyer and Astra Taylor, just wrote a book about this for Verso, called the The Right to Have Rights. This is part 2. It‚Äôs strongly suggested that you listen to part 1 first.</p>
