<p>In a celebrated clip from his capitalist propaganda documentary series â€œFree to Choose,â€ the economist Milton Friedman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ERbC7JyCfU&amp;ab_channel=LibertyPen">holds up a wooden pencil</a> to illustrate what he describes as â€œthe magic of the price system.â€ It is only â€œthe impersonal operation of prices,â€ Friedman tells us, which is capable of marshaling the efforts of thousands of people to turn raw materials â€” wood from Washington state, graphite from mines in South America, rubber from trees in â€œMalayaâ€ â€” into the everyday products on which we rely. In Friedmanâ€™s telling, the market is not only the source of all the conveniences of the modern age, but the only force capable of â€œfoster[ing] harmony and peace among the peoples of the world.â€</p>

<p>There are some gaps in Friedmanâ€™s story. To take just one example: the rubber industry of â€œMalayaâ€ (which had ceased to be a nation nearly twenty years before the filming of Free to Choose) was built not by the impersonal forces of the free market, but by European colonizers, who grew rich off of the un- and underpaid labor of mostly migrant workers â€” many of whom died in service of British capital. As recently as 2018, the US Department of Labor included rubber gloves from Malaysia on a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods-print?items_per_page=10&amp;combine=rubber">list of goods likely produced through forced labor</a>. From the pencil industry, to the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, to the genocidal â€œsettlingâ€ of the American West, markets have developed not through the magic of the price system but through coercion and racialized violence backed by state power.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674979529">Globalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism</a>, historian Quinn Slobodian argued that paeans to cooperation and harmony aside, neoliberals often understood perfectly well that free markets built through coercion do not require free people, and that democracy might represent a threat to the smooth functioning of markets built and maintained through coercion. Thus, as decolonization began to upend the international order in the mid-to-late-twentieth century, neoliberals associated with what Slobodian calls â€œthe Geneva Schoolâ€ sought to build supra-national institutions capable of encasing markets and protecting them from democratic oversight.</p>

<p>In his new book <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250753892/crackupcapitalism">Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy</a>, Slobodian brings the story into the present, writing about the neoliberals, libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists who, having come to see freedom and democracy as fundamentally incompatible, seek an escape through â€œzonesâ€: subnational jurisdictions which work to attract investment by cordoning themselves off from the burdens of taxation, labor law, and democratic accountability.</p>

<p>From Hong Kong in the 1970s and Londonâ€™s canary wharf in the 1980s, to twenty-first-century Dubai and the metaverse, these figures â€” including MAGA billionaire Peter Thiel, Milton Friedmanâ€™s grandson, leaders of the alt-right, and Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein â€” have celebrated these zones as models of a new global order on the rise, one characterized by â€œa radical form of capitalism in a world without democracy.â€</p>

<p>Both Slobodianâ€™s book and his conversation with Dan are essential for leftists â€” not just for readers and listeners who want a better understanding of trends in global capitalism or more insight into the dystopian fantasies of the techno-libertarian fringe, but as what Slobodian calls a â€œnegative modelâ€ of the sort of visions that those of us who want a more democratic and more equitable future might develop. After all, though their cyberpunk inflected-fantasies â€” from creating literal islands of white supremacy to colonizing Mars to living in the cloud â€” are by turns horrifying and ludicrous, they are both diagnosing something real in our current order, and searching within that order for the seeds of what might come next.</p>

<p>Taking these figures seriously allows us to hit on a key stumbling block on the path to libertarian exit, one which Slobodian discusses in the bookâ€™s conclusion. â€œZones are everywhere,â€ Slobodian writes, â€œbut contrary to the rhetoric of boosters, they do not seem to be creating islands of liberation from the state. Rather, states are using them as tools to advance their own purposes.â€ If the proliferation of zones has actually strengthened the state, then democratic mobilization within those states might represent the best chance to build a future defined not by authoritarianism and commodification, but by solidarity, mutuality, and reciprocity.</p>
