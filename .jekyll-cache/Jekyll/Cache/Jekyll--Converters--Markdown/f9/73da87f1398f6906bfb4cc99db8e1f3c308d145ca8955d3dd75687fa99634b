I"«<p>Mark Blyth wasn‚Äôt surprised by the rise of Donald Trump, nor Brexit, nor the crises spreading across Europe. He actually predicted them all.¬†</p>

<p>Blyth, the author of ‚ÄúAusterity: The History of a Dangerous Idea,‚Äù explains how economic crisis has led to upheaval in a political establishment that worked obsessively to eliminate inflation and maximize profits at the expense of general wellbeing. This crisis has produced horrific peril, as the Trump administration‚Äôs first weeks have made clear. But for the Left, it also provides historic opportunities.</p>

<p>Blyth recently spoke with Daniel Denvir during a live taping of the Dig in front of a crowd of 150 in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
