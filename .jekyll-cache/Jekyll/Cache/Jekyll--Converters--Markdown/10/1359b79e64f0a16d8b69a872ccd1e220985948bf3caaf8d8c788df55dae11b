<p>A lengthy interview with historian Barbara Fields and sociologist Karen Fields on their seminal essay collection <em>Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life</em>. Dan talks to the sister scholars about the book; how Ta-Nehisi Coatesâ€™ primordialist view of white racism spells defeat; that racism serves the interest of capitalist class war, and endless debates over Rachel Dolezal distract us from that fact; and a whole ton more. This is over two hours, so you might want to bite it off on a few chunks, or on a long drive. Thanks to our sponsors at Verso.
