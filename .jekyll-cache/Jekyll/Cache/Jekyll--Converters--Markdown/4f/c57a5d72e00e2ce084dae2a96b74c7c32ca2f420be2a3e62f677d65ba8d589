<p>Striking women have begun to reclaim feminism as a project of working-class struggle against not only patriarchy‚Äôs domination of women by men but also against capitalism‚Äôs domination of the many by the few‚Äîa system that sexism serves. As Cinzia Arruzza, Tithi Bhattacharya and Nancy Fraser write in 
, ‚ÄúOur answer to lean-in feminism is kick-back feminism. We have no interest in breaking the glass ceiling while leaving the vast majority to clean up the shards. Far from celebrating women CEOs who occupy corner offices, we want to get rid of CEOs and corner offices.‚Äù Dan interviews Tithi Bhattacharya.</p>
