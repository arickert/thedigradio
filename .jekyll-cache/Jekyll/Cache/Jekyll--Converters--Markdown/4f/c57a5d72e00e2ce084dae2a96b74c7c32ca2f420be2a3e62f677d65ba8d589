<p>Striking women have begun to reclaim feminism as a project of working-class struggle against not only patriarchy’s domination of women by men but also against capitalism’s domination of the many by the few—a system that sexism serves. As Cinzia Arruzza, Tithi Bhattacharya and Nancy Fraser write in 
, “Our answer to lean-in feminism is kick-back feminism. We have no interest in breaking the glass ceiling while leaving the vast majority to clean up the shards. Far from celebrating women CEOs who occupy corner offices, we want to get rid of CEOs and corner offices.” Dan interviews Tithi Bhattacharya.</p>
