I"©<p>Today, we‚Äôre talking about Italy, where a so-called ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù alliance of the Five Star Movement and right-wing League just took over the government with anti-migrant and Euro-skeptic agenda. Dan‚Äôs guest is David Broder, a historian of French and Italian communism and frequent contributor to Jacobin. The Five Star Movement was for a time welcomed by some on the left. But it‚Äôs not of the left; rather, it is a product of the Italian left‚Äôs collapse.</p>
